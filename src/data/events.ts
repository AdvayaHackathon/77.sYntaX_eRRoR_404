Visitors can experience cutting-edge theater, stand-up comedy, physical performance, music, children's shows, exhibitions, and countless performances that defy categorization.

Originally held to celebrate a royal wedding, today's Oktoberfest welcomes over six million visitors to Munich's festival grounds (Theresienwiese). The event begins with a colorful parade of breweries and the ceremonial tapping of the first keg by Munich's mayor. Inside the massive festival tents, each operated by a different historic brewery, visitors experience traditional Bavarian hospitality while enjoying specially brewed Oktoberfest beer served in one-liter steins by staff in dirndls and lederhosen. Live bands play traditional oompah music alongside folk dances, while guests enjoy hearty Bavarian specialties like pretzels, roast chicken, and schweinshaxe (pork knuckle). Beyond the main festival grounds, visitors can explore special exhibitions on brewing history, traditional costume displays, and family-friendly attractions including carnival rides. Oktoberfest offers cultural tourists a joyful immersion into Bavarian traditions that have been carefully preserved while welcoming the world to participate.",
